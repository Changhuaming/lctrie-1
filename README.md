# Fast IP Routing with LC-Tries

Based on the paper "Fast address lookup for Internet routers" by Stefan Nilsson and Gunnar Karlsson. 
This is the reference code for the Dr.Dobb's [article](http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fast-ip-routing-with-lc-tries/184410638)
from Aug 1998. 

You can also find parts of the trie used in the linux kernel (fib_trie.c)
